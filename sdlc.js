// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "After planning, the next step is to cleary specify and document the software requirements for the software."
const design = "The analysis is then used as a reference point for designing the blueprints or architecture for the way the software would be developed. The design documents are also shared with the customer to ensure satisfaction before moving forward with building."
const Implementation = "Afterwards the building of the software begins following the details of the design document to ensure smooth development"
const testingAndIntegration = "As the development continues any previous steps of SDLC are addressed as needed maintaining communication with the customer to ensure satisfaction. Testing of the software is necessary to address any bugs or changes that arise during development and integration"
const Maintain = "After deployment, feedback can be gathered and addressed by pushing newer versions of the software with suggested or necessary enhancements"
